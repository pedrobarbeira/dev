Reports #1 | Enchantments #1 
- Pedro Barbeira

Foreword:

Being the first instance of a report in this new Journey, the following lines will give a broad overview of the approach chosen for this undertaking. The Divine Polarities teach us about Order and Chaos, and how a solid structure is the foundation that allows all things to flow freely. Therefore it makes sense to develop and establish a structured methodology for the reports to follow, as a means of 1) provide a framework for clear analysis and understanding of the workings at hand; and 2) allow the reader to follow on the procedures in a familiar and consistent format. The nature of the Work is quite abstract, in and of itself, therefore a solid foundation will be a powerful ally in the following months.
The reports will follow the traditional academic structure of Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion/Conclusion and, when so required, References. Reports may or may not have a foreword with relevant information - like this particular instance. 
In the Abstract the reader can find a show rundown of the whole scope of the report. The Introduction will provide context, goals and assumed preconceptions - ideally it’ll be written while preparing the work, and completed upon the work’s completion. Methods will provide some in depth information about the energetic technologies used and the hows and whys of using them, gradually building into the combination methods and formulas applied. The Results will present any and all noticed changes and effects of the application of the previously described methods. In the Discussion the Reader will find an in-depth analysis of what went right and wrong, how the used methods can be improved upon, and any deeper findings on the chosen technologies (provided said findings can be compressed in written word). The References will contain any websites, books or tomes from which inspiration or information was drawn from.
We hope that following this procedure will create a solid framework of research and understanding, allowing the student to develop not only his magickal skill, but also his analytical skills. The used format has been tried and true as a form of both reflecting upon and sharing research. It’s also expected that the approach will allow the reader to have a more profound view of the whole process, from the research of information, to the assembling of the working, to the performance and posterior analysis of it. Hopefully this method will bring any inconsistencies and bad practices to light, and it’s expected of the student to correct and perfect them as quickly as possible.
Regarding the content/nature of each report, an effort will be made to reach an equilibrium of both abstract, conceptual exploration and concrete, practical application. Action’s can only go as deep as the Mind can perceive, and the Mind can only assimilate as much one Acts. Therefore a good balance of both polarities is necessary.
Each Module will initialized with an abstract/conceptual report on the nature of the Module itself. The goal is to open pathways and arrive at some concrete endpoints on which practical workings can be applied. The goal of this initial period is to deepen the understanding of the practice associated with the Module. 
The student will start off the process by exposing his current understanding of the practice in the Introduction section, detail his methods in the Methods section and his findings in the Results section, and finally access/upgrade his initial perspectives on the Discussion/Conclusion section. The idea is not only to step into the practice fully and understand it’s inner workings before applying in practice, but also allow the grader to access the conceptual framework the student is working with.
This initial research will be followed by a few practical undertakings, ideally 4, which will be thoroughly documented as detailed above. Then another conceptual period will start. This iterative process envisions to mix both conceptual understanding and practical experience, allowing the student to put his theories to the test and reaccessing them afterwards, thus creating a feedback loop. The method is in itself a theory which will have to be put to test, acting as a learning hyper sigil - as any learning framework does.

Abstract:

This initial report exposes the student’s current understanding of what Enchantment is, as well as how and where to apply it. The process will be mainly observational, relying on both researched information and creative thinking. The goal is to arrive at a solid understanding of Enchantment, how and why it works, and what are the benefits/dangers of applying it in daily life.To anchor this process in physical reality, the student will undertake the challenge of finding/creating a wand for himself - which will also be thoroughly documented throughout the report.

Introduction:

Enchantment, as currently understood, is the act of drawing upon and directing energetical currents towards a specific target with a specific end. This target can be a point in time, like a date or season; or a point in space, like an object, a being or even a room. By applying his intention to the energetic current, the magician imprints his Will upon it, thus reinforcing/weakening the gravitational pull created by said current.
Newton’s Third Law of Motion politely explains what’s commonly known as Karma - or, as the Three Initiates called it, the Principle of Cause and Effect. In a magickal background, it’s widely understood that physical reality is made up of an seemingly infinite number of intertwined chains of causality. It’s also widely known that these chains are more similar to a graph then they are to actual chains. Each action creates, at the very least, two branches: the one where the action was taken, and the one where the action wasn’t taken. This, of course, is in a closed environment, an isolated system, which can only be obtained in a setting similar to being alone in a closed, sound-proofed room. The system’s complexity rapidly increases when we consider the effects of outside influence, like other people, animals or even the very atoms. Either way, the basis is simple: the actions we take dictate which actions we’ll be able to take next - a very interesting concept that can be physically experienced while observing the flow of a yoga session, and how certain postures are only achievable through the combination of prior postures.
These several possible chains condense themselves in a main chain, which creates the illusion of linear time and precipitates as what we call physical reality. We can observe this in the process of building a house, or starting a company, or kicking off a project. The more people gather in the endeavor, the easier it’ll be to bring it to reality. If they manage to subside their egos in favor of success and align themselves towards the same direction, the chances of manifesting said objective will increase exponentially.
As such, these chains congregate towards what Lao Tzu called The Tao. For, as we certainly know, all things come from One, and to One all things return. Somewhere along the line of continuous differentiation, Humans show up. Somewhere along the line of continuous integration, physical reality forms.
What is then, the directive that makes these lines congregate? We can find the answer in gravity. Gravity is dependent on mass and radius, and the gravitational constant. Let’s shift this constant to probability of something happening - which, as we’ve seen in above, is dependent on several factors, like how many entities are aligned towards the success of the endeavor. Our radius is, clearly, related to focus - the smaller the radius (ergo, the stronger the focus), the bigger the gravitational pull. And our mass, well, to the energy we can amass and direct towards our goal.There is m1, the mass of the magicians energy, injected through his intention; and m2, the mass of energy the magician is directing.
Thus, as we can see, the success of failure of an enchantment can be easily understood using the framework of gravity. By selecting the right currents and applying the right intention in the right direction, with as much focus as the magician can muster, the success rate can be maximized. Understanding the energies we draw upon will allow us to pick and choose the right ones for the task. Deepening our relationship with them through practice will allow us to draw more energy in and through us. Strengthening our Will will allow us to increase our focus. Clearing our mind will allow us to craft the right intention.
The key here is to attain a high degree of granularity. The farther away our desire is from our current physical reality, the lower the probability of precipitating it will be. Breaking down the process into a series of small, incremental steps will allow us to carve a path with high success rate. The key is figuring out what’s the most relevant smallest step we can take towards our goal. The ability to parse through the options and select the right one can only be obtained through practice and experience, since it’s based on intuitive knowing: trying to warp our mind around the infinite ramifications of an action is a sure way to insanity. Enchantment is, therefore, the bridge between the magician’s inner world of possibility and desire and the magician’s outer world of factuality and achievement. It’s the process that turns idea into object, potential into realization. 
Energy requires action as an anchor point to enter our reality. It doesn't matter if we can conjure up the most powerful entities or craft the most elaborate rituals if we don't act up on them. Enchantment provides just that: an easy entry point for the directed mass to find it's way to our current timeline. While there are many traditional formulas, from the complex procedures of high magick, to the mystical concotions of low magick, to chanting, truth is anything can become an act of Enchantment. Something as simple as a look, a movement or a breathe can be used to practice the Art, provided the practicioner can infuse said actions with enough intent. At the limit, no action is required - the mere presence of the magician is enough to drawn in the required energies for the work at hand. This, of course, is not a proper framework for practice and study - although observation has shown that it's the most common form of Enchantment, due to its unconscious nature.  To practice and study we need something simple enough to be applied regularly and in many situations, which puts any form of ritual out of the table, and something complex enough to bring in a special focus and intent to the instance, thus excluding sight, breath and mental projection. 
Symbols present themselves as the perfect medium through which to study and experiment with this practice. They can easily act as keys, connecting us to the energies we desire to draw upon. We can easily draw them, either in our minds or with our wands (or even fingers) and almost immediatly observe certain effects. We also have a vast body of symbols from which to draw upon. From the widely known sigils of Astrology to the more underground icons of alchemy to the obscure seals of Solomon's book, there's a vast array of tried-and-true keys which can be applied to exercise and develop this practice. Not only that, symbols can easily be combined and structured in sigils, mixing and matching different energies to arrive at the potion that better suits our work and goals. The act of crafting a sigil is a skill in and off itself, one which can only be learnt by trial and error, but nonetheless relevant to our study. As the skill of Enchantment develops itself, so will develop the understanding of each energy at hand, which in turn will open up the pathways to successfully combining them. 

Methods:
- Theoretical Study: if a symbol has been around for quite some time, chances are we can find a lot of information about it, both in books and online. While relying solely on external sources will make the practicioner a sad excuse for a parrot, truth is there's no point reinventing the wheel. Soaking one's mind in material regarding a particular symbol is a great way to amass a general understanding of it, and may even result in personal insights being revealed. Eihter way, accessing and informing oneself about what one's dealing with before taking the steps to actually deal with is quite the wise course of action. 
- Meditation: this would be the sandbox of enchantment practice. Meditating on a symbol allows the practicioner to direcly access and soak themselves in that particular energy. Deepening the understanding of the symbol is deepening the relationship with it, therefore strengthening the inner channels that direct that particular current. Dedication and consistent effort will result in personal insights being obtained, a crucial step in shifting from apprentice to master. Meditation also allows the practictioner to experiment with possible combinations and project them into different situations, drawing in, at the very least, some theoretical expectations of why they would or would not work. This process can save tremendous time, energy and setbacks along the way.
- Drawing: the act of drawing a symbol on paper is a strong magickal practice. Not only is the practicioner connecting to the frequency, he's consciously directing that frequency through both his physical body and an external object, in order to manifest it in reality in the form of a drawing. The pen can be, for all purposed and effects, considered a Wand (maybe the very first one, given our society's education system). The act is similar to meditating on a symbol, only slower, thus allowing for a higher degree of granularity. Conclusions can be drawn from how each line is set and how it connects with other lines, and the very order of drawing can illicit personal insights and deeper intentions. In time paper can be put aside and the drawing can be energetic, progressing into projecting a mental image into the desired target.
- Chanting: chanting is a powerful tool, known since the old days. When done right it makes all our bodies vibrate in the frequency of the enegy we're trying to connect with. It must be handled with proper care and respect. It's an integral part of many rituals, and can be easily performed during daily life casting, either in the form of whispers or mentally verbalized - the more extroverted ones can also shout the word of power direcly at their foes for extra points.
- Application: for this two weak period it was decided to explore the tool of Enchantment as a means to facilitate a personal transition, particularly letting go of the habit of smoking. Certain sigils can be called upon to facilitate this change: the discipline of Capricorn, the courage of Saggitarius, the physical prowess of Uruz, the mental strength of Ansuz, the dedication of Gebo, the inspiration of Algiz. During the last 2 weeks these sigils, among others, were drawn upon in times of need, with the intention of fighting urges, staying on track, mustering the strength to break the habit, and whatever else was required. Each usage is documented and reflected upon in the following section. 

Results:
>Experiment #1
*Objective: to turn smoking a cigarette into another step towards quitting
*Motivation: drawing upon the lessons of Capricorn, each mistake can either be a setback or a lesson learned. Applying this insight into the act of smoking one can make a pack become a guide through the process of quitting
*Description: some sigils were drawn upon the pack:
    - Capricorn: draw in the energy of preserverance and dedication, as well as the aforementioned lessons 
    - ChoKuRei: draw in the healing energy of Reiki to each cigarette
    - Thurisaz: connect to the unconcious motives that generate the habit and to the hidden forces that feed off of it.
    - Sowelu: provide a guiding light to handle said currents and draw in success
    - Algiz: divine inspiration to arrive at insights, protection
*Intention: to break the negative feedback loop of smoking (smoking = failure = tension = smoking again) by uprooting the underlying hooks that generate attachment to the habit 
*Effect:
    - Upon finishing the pack, the craving to smoke immediately showed itself. It was a first time such thing happened, and was taken as chance to quickly start working on deconstructing the habit-fueling patterns.
    - An hour later still no cravings showed up. While the idea of smoking presented itself somewhat regularly, the mind was quick to dismiss it. A certain inner fire fueled the motivation to quit. The pros and cons were as clear as always, there was simply no underlying reason to keep smoking.
    - The habit crept back in again over the weekend, to much detriment of this seeker. Even so the gains were stable and true. 

>Experiment #2
*Objective: to reinforce the effect described on Experiment #1
*Motivation: take advantage of Experiment #1 to practice recurrent Enchantment and experiment with/deepen connection to a particular sigil
*Descripton: a particular bindrune will be drawn in the air before smoking each cigarette. This bindrune will be used in a posterior working and is the result of a week and a half's worth of effort and research. It's comprised of Fehu, Ansuz, Gebo, Algiz and Ehwaz and aims at facilitating understanding of a particular subject.

*Intention: explore the aforementioned bindrune and practice drawing energetic symbols and Enchantment
*Effect:
   - The first cigarettes were quite enlightening. Several ideas popped up, from past events that were generating blockages, both regarding smoking and other areas, and around more general topics. A certain anxiety about reinforcing the vice by associating the insight with the act of smoking presented itself, but was quickly subdued by the integration of the fact that the enchantment was doing all the work - the cigarette was just acting like a vessel, much like incense sticks may act as vessels for magick. Contrary to prior experiences, each cigarette triggered a healing sensation in the crown area.
   - Halfway throught he pack the will to quit started forming. It became clear that the vice wasn't really adding much. Insights were more interesting. The need to quit also become quite apparent - the effects of the substances of the smoke made intuition less clear and obstructed vision. The realization that this obstruction could lead to poor choices in regard to temporal optimization and scheduling came quickly after 
    - An hour after finishing the pack, the words "a pact was made, a pact was broken" come to mind. In the sense that the working previously described acted as a means to break some hidden link that was keeping the habit alive. 
    - Throughout the process many personal insights were revealed, many of which laid upon the foundation of not smoking, or rather, upon the foundation of the energetic state and flow achieved during periods of abstinence. The main difference between other similar instropections was the depth of integration achieved, which attests the efficacy of the Enchantment.
    - The sigil seemed to lose some effect after a certain period. Probably due to continuous integration of the energy and loss of novelty. The next bindrune to try out presented itself

>Experiment #3
*Objective: Easing the process of finishing a coding assignment
*Motivation: Applying the sigil mentioned in Experiment #2 in a constructive endeavor
*Descripton: The sigil will be drawn before each work session and whenever roadblocks are met
*Intention: Facilitating the problem-solving process by increasing the insight throughtput
*Effect:
  - When applied while studying theory, the sigil resulted in increased focus and assimilation. At first the flow of information was somewhat overwhelming and the mind felt more erratic then usual. With proper intent and focus these side effects quickly subsided, resulting in a much more accelerated process, with a higher rate of retention compared to instances where the material was being processed at a similar rate.
  - A certain clarity and guidance while coding showed up in the form of clear intuitive understanding of where and how the programs could be improved upon and optimized. It was also noticed an increased ease in visualizing the flow of the program, sorting out the different cases and flows of execution and mentally holding multiple objects simultaneously.
  - The project was finished successfully. There was still room for improvement, as always, but from a certain point onward the improvement felt insignificant when compared to the ammount of effort required to achieve it. This cost/benefit analysis was an important step, nonetheless. Most likely the biggest takeaway
  
>Experiment #4
*Objective: Making it through the final week of the semester as well as possible
*Motivation: As classes come to an end and finals draw in nearer, stress builds up and tension accumulates. Having a guide through these turbulent waters is sure to ease the process
*Description: Similar to prior practices, but exploring a different sigil comprised of Ehwaz and Sowilo
*Intention: Stimulate a shadow work/integration process and be guided through it
*Effects:


Discussion:
>Thoughts on The Wand
Having started out my spiritual parth as I was studying drums, and having one of the most spiritual person's i've ever had the pleasure to met as menthor, my first wand was, undoubtly, the body. Ever since I took my first steps into energy working and wondered how would I perform magick, if I ever so desired, that it was clear to me that any and all forms of magick should be performed through my body. What good is being able to cast extremely powerful and complex rituals if one can't direcly influence his reality sphere at a moment's notice?
Therefore, finding a wand was definetly one of the hardest challenges - one I was butting heads with prior to writting the application letter. The wand should be flexible, yet sturdy. The wand should, ideally, be disguised as an everyday object (bear in mind I have ritual wands, therefore the challenge was figuring out a pocket wand to work with in public). The wand should fit in my pocket and be something that wouldn't draw attention if fidgeted with.
At first I thought about my cellphone. It felt off tho. The wifi connection could easily tamper with the working. Imagine getting a call from the boss you hate while performing a quick healing spell. Or a text from a project colleague as you're laying the groundwork for your dream vacation. Definetly not a wise choice.
Then I thought about the pen. Certainly is no problem carrying a pen, and certainly it's not weird to fidget a pen and sketch some air drawings. Bypassers could simply dismiss it as some hyper focused over achieving college student trying to crack some weird equation. But the pen was my last wand, one I already know deeply, and would rather use in private and away from prying eyes - needless to stay my pencil case is one of my most well-kept items.
The insight landed while coming home from having a coffee. The perfect wand was already in my hand, all along, sitting there idly: my keychain. The size is perfect - roughly from the base of the palm to the tip of my middle finger. The one I use more often is quite larger than all others, acting as the focus point, the laser beam. The rest can be drawn in the hand and mimic a handle. Not only that, they're attached to a ring, which allows me to easily bend the wand without breaking it (a total game changer, certainly). Plus everyone has a set of keys, and fidgeting/air sketching with a set of keys is as normal and ordinary as doing it with a pen (but quite less noticeable then with a phone or a doll of sorts).
The fact my current path is highly focused on opening pathways, exploring depths, and both aquiring and deepening knowledge also aligns perfecly with the physical properties of the wand. To all purposes and effects, what I'm focused on is opening and walking through conceptual doors. Therefore using a keychain as a wand feels quite right and suited.
This said, I'll never put aside my trustworthy index finger. A time-proven ally in all cases and scenarios.

>The Fear of Casting
The practice lead to a increased frequency of casting. Several castings were made each day, in different situations. This lead to the realization that at some deep, subconcious level, the practice of magick was still considered something "wrong", in the sense of dangerous. Something that should be used only on very specific situations. The recurrency of casting led to tearing down this belief, and thus a mindset shift: magick gained a dimension of experimentation. Several ideas regarding venues of application of the currently available tools started presenting themselves, along with open paths of integration into the daily routine. Before, magick felt like a subject of central focus, something which would take up all the space and time available. Now it feels like a pervasive subject, a loyal companion which should be catered with the proper attention and care, but can also adjust itself to fit in the available space in one's life.

>Thoughts on the Work
So far the week proved more intense than expected. Clearly there must be a balance between regular action and casts. Too much regular action makes an hobby out of the practice, too much cast turns life into a very tiring and strenuous experience. Each process should be properly seen through and mostly integrated before initiating a new one. This way we can ensure a proper equilibrium and steer away from burning out of overwhelming ourselves. Overall the Work seems pretty intense and demanding, although there is a clear focus on consistency as farm as demands go, and the intensity dillutes a fair bit when such consistency is applied.
While an in-depth report was the chosen medium for this first assignment, future assignments will most likely benefit from a more journal-like approach. Combining the more personal and intimate environment of journaling with the same analytical intention applied thus far seems like the best next step.
It is important to consider the Work and pursue it, but also not lose track of what's important in one's own life. Afterall, the Work isn't something which can be decided upon. It's a lifelong quest towards achieve one's potential. Manifesting said potential in all areas of life can be argued to be the best and most challenging Work one can possibly strive for. Thus it's important to keep all matters tightly together and craft methods with coexistence in mind. An effort will be made to update the report daily, since that has proven to be the first challenge. The next step will surely present itself when the time comes.

>Problem: How to identify a common problem?
* Why is it a problem?
  - Everyone has different problems. Everyone attributes diferent importances to said problems. Also, what may seem like a problem for someone might be just another day in the office for other person. This makes identifying common problems very hard. Asking people will end in having several different answers, but at the same time it's not the type of thing one can do on his own. This is a problem in and off itself. There are many people who want to solve common problems and drive the world forward, but only a few can identify what are the actual problems that must be addressed at a particular time (i.e during a particular year). We also tend to only pay mind to the problems of our own demographic and surroundings. While this makes the search set much smaller and provides a certain order of priority, truth is it isolates us from the bigger picture - we end up solving problems common to only a particular group of people. Maybe this is the way - choose a particular demographic, a particular target audience, identify their problem and work on solving that particular problem. Maybe not.
  
* Where does it come from?
  - We tend to either attribute more value to our own problems, or less value. This can lead to 1) believing a personal problem is a common problem for many other people, or 2) mistaking an actual common problem that needs solving for a personal problem that we must figure out on our own. We end up relying on market researches and creating feedback loops that allow us to extract information about what our target audience believes the problem to be. However, as inner work easily shows, hardly ever are we actually aware of what our problems are. This raises the question: should we address the problem people want solved (commercial orientation) or the problem we know people need solved (personal orientation). 
  
* How does it perpetuate itself?
  - The reliance on market studies and commercial uses makes it so we never actually develop the skill of identifying problems. We end up practicing a lot of problem solving, but too little of problem identification. This is a skill in and off itself, one that many professions - clynical psychologists, doctors, maintenance workers - develop over years of experience. Focusing on developing this feel of problem identification can fast forward us in life. It'll also make many of our challenges easier - we'll be able toe asily detect and identify what is blocking us in a particular situation and address it right away, uprooting the core cause right from start.
  
* Is it worth being fixed?
  -Yes. Although this might not be a common problem people face, it's certainly a problem a lot of people face. Or perhaps even a problem that people aren't aware they face. Right now it's a personal problem, a very pressing one at that, and a nice opportunity to apply the problem solving framework described above. Solving this problem is the first step to solve real, impactful problems that will affect people's life in meaningful ways.
  
* What's it's purpose?
  - To teach us how to see past apperances and quickly identify the root causes of a problem. Identifying a problem requires peeling through several layers of noise. Only by diving deep and seeing past the superficial effects can we arrive at the core of it - and only then can we start solving it, from the core outwards.
  
* What makes up a problem?
  - It starts with disconfort. Disconfort is the guiding light that tells us something is wrong. When something generates the same kind of disconfort consistently we call it a problem. Metaphysically it's a particular energy. Quite tense and uncler. Usually the result of mixed energies and residues.
  - The solution isn't known or obvious. Problems with trivial solutions aren't problems. Usually the problem's complexity is above our confort zone. It can either be a big problem - very distant from our threshold; a small problem - near our threshold, right below it; or a problem - above our threshold at a reachable distance. These are the ones we generally want to undertake
  - Can be broken appart in smaller problems. Again, a problem with a trivial solution (ergo, can't be broken down in a series of smaller sub problems) isn't really a problem. Usually we can come up with a tree-like structure that differentiates our problem into a series of small trivial problems (this process helps with understanding)
  - Usually an effect, not a cause - we can trace back a problem into a root cause, which may or may not be of higher complexity. For example, a very tense and difficult relationship might boil down to lack of communication, which might boil down to inner assumptions and expectations one or both partners make of the other, which usually boils down to worlview or childhood trauma. Worldview can be easily changed if there's a will to change it, childhood trauma is a whole different can of worms.
  
* How can it be broken down?
  
* Come up with a solution
  1) Keep meditating on the nature of the problem.
  2) Look for research and literature about problem solving and problem identification
  3) Find more questions to be answered
  4) Ask other people about it
  
* Create a prototype:
  1) Look for situations that generate disconfort
  2) Peel the layers off iteratively
  3) Identify the root cause of the problem
  
* User Test
  1) Identify personal problems and solve them (you know what they are)

* Launch it
  1) Apply method to external areas
